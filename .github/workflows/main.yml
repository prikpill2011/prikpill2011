This code:

- Triggers the workflow on push events to the main branch
- Uses the latest Ubuntu runner
- Checks out the code
- Installs dependencies using npm
- Runs the UI tests using the `npm run ui-tests` command

*Note*: Replace `npm run ui-tests` with the actual command you use to run your UI tests.

1. *Commit and push your changes*: Save the file and commit it to your repository.

This workflow will now automatically run your UI tests on every push event to the main branch.
